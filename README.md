# console-log
Outputs JavaScript console.log calls to a floating div which allows you to debug on mobile devices or Browserstack.

This is a little experiment that attempts to mimic a console in an environment that doesn't have easy access to one. I am using [highlightjs](highlightjs.org) for the syntax highlighting, however it will work fine without it. I will probably try and make this a Grunt plugin in the future.
